# Hack The Box Academy

{% embed url="https://academy.hackthebox.com/" %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Hack the Box has 2 training platforms. If you are brand new and don't want to start\
with TryHackMe then I would highly recommend starting here and NOT on regular Hack\
the Box.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

```
PROS:
1. Free for basic modules
2. Easy to follow and understand
3. A lot of great material to get you started
4. Very affordable for the information you get
5. Constantly being added to and updated

CONS:
1. Can be pricey without a .edu email
2. Can be a bit advanced for some users
3. Questions at the end of modules can be hard to understand
4. Only focuses on web and network. (other platforms offer blue and purple team)
```

{% hint style="success" %}
If you have a .edu email or can obtain one this is the best bang for the buck on the market as of now!&#x20;
