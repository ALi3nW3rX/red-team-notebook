# Enumerating & Retrieving Password Policies

### Enumerating the Password Policy - from Linux - SMB NULL Sessions&#x20;

Without credentials, we may be able to obtain the password policy via an SMB NULL session or LDAP anonymous bind. The first is via an SMB NULL session. SMB NULL sessions allow an unauthenticated attacker to retrieve information from the domain, such as a complete listing of users, groups, computers, user account attributes, and the domain password policy. SMB NULL session misconfigurations are often the result of legacy Domain Controllers being upgraded in place, ultimately bringing along insecure configurations, which existed by default in older versions of Windows Server.

When creating a domain in earlier versions of Windows Server, anonymous access was granted to certain shares, which allowed for domain enumeration. An SMB NULL session can be enumerated easily. For enumeration, we can use tools such as <mark style="color:green;">`enum4linux`</mark>, <mark style="color:green;">`CrackMapExec`</mark>, <mark style="color:green;">`rpcclient`</mark>, etc.

We can use rpcclient to check a Domain Controller for SMB NULL session access.

Once connected, we can issue an RPC command such as querydominfo to obtain information about the domain and confirm NULL session access.

### Enumerating the Password Policy - from Linux - LDAP Anonymous Bind

LDAP anonymous binds allow unauthenticated attackers to retrieve information from the domain, such as a complete listing of users, groups, computers, user account attributes, and the domain password policy.&#x20;

This is a legacy configuration, and as of Windows Server 2003, only authenticated users are permitted to initiate LDAP requests. We still see this configuration from time to time as an admin may have needed to set up a particular application to allow anonymous binds and given out more than the intended amount of access, thereby giving unauthenticated users access to all objects in AD.

With an LDAP anonymous bind, we can use LDAP-specific enumeration tools such as windapseach.py, ldapsearch, ad-ldapdomaindump.py, etc., to pull the password policy. With ldapsearch, it can be a bit cumbersome but doable. One example command to get the password policy is as follows:

```
ldapsearch -h 172.16.5.5 -x -b "DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL" -s sub "*" | grep -m 1 -B 10 pwdHistoryLength

forceLogoff: -9223372036854775808
lockoutDuration: -18000000000
lockOutObservationWindow: -18000000000
lockoutThreshold: 5
maxPwdAge: -9223372036854775808
minPwdAge: -864000000000
minPwdLength: 8
modifiedCountAtLastProm: 0
nextRid: 1002
pwdProperties: 1
pwdHistoryLength: 24
```

### Enumerating the Password Policy - from Windows

If we can authenticate to the domain from a Windows host, we can use built-in Windows binaries such as net.exe to retrieve the password policy. We can also use various tools such as PowerView, CrackMapExec ported to Windows, SharpMapExec, SharpView, etc.

Using built-in commands is helpful if we land on a Windows system and cannot transfer tools to it, or we are positioned on a Windows system by the client, but have no way of getting tools onto it. One example using the built-in net.exe binary is:

```
C:\> net accounts

Force user logoff how long after time expires?:       Never
Minimum password age (days):                          1
Maximum password age (days):                          Unlimited
Minimum password length:                              8
Length of password history maintained:                24
Lockout threshold:                                    5
Lockout duration (minutes):                           30
Lockout observation window (minutes):                 30
Computer role:                                        SERVER
The command completed successfully.
```

### Analyzing the Password Policy

* The minimum password length is 8 (8 is very common, but nowadays, we are seeing more and more organizations enforce a 10-14 character password, which can remove some password options for us, but does not mitigate the password spraying vector completely)
* The account lockout threshold is 5 (it is not uncommon to see a lower threshold such as 3 or even no lockout threshold set at all)
* The lockout duration is 30 minutes (this may be higher or lower depending on the organization), so if we do accidentally lockout (avoid!!) an account, it will unlock after the 30-minute window passes
* Accounts unlock automatically (in some organizations, an admin must manually unlock the account). We never want to lockout accounts while performing password spraying, but we especially want to avoid locking out accounts in an organization where an admin would have to intervene and unlock hundreds (or thousands) of accounts by hand/script
* Password complexity is enabled, meaning that a user must choose a password with 3/4 of the following: an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, special character (Password1 or Welcome1 would satisfy the "complexity" requirement here, but are still clearly weak passwords).

The default password policy when a new domain is created is as follows, and there have been plenty of organizations that never changed this policy:

```
Policy	Default Value
Enforce password history	24 days
Maximum password age	42 days
Minimum password age	1 day
Minimum password length	7
Password must meet complexity requirements	Enabled
Store passwords using reversible encryption	Disabled
Account lockout duration	Not set
Account lockout threshold	0
Reset account lockout counter after	Not set
```
